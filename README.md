# Pre-process-and-Qlearning-in-BCN
Boolean Control Network(BCN) is always applied on GRNs. In a BCN with n nodes, every node is a is a boolean variable whose value can only be 0 or 1. The iteration of BN is always descripted by a discrete time model in which every time of iteration is called a timestep. The value of the nodes rely on the initial value of themselves respectively, also receive the influence from the other nodes in a timestep. The function which describes the iteration of BCN is called state transition function. According to states transition function, the value of nodes is calculated by boolean operations. Obviously, the BN can be modeled as a Markov process. In order to enable the chosen nodes to switch into target states, we set control nodes which are controlable boolean variables with exclusive OR. As a result, the BN turns into BCN. If we model BCN as Markov decision process(MDP), it turns out that we can use Reinforcement Learning to study the control problem. Moreover, we use Qlearning with pre-process to enshort calculations.
